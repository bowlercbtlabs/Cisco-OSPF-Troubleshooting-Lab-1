# Cisco OSPF Troubleshooting - Lab 1

## Trouble Ticket #1

### Problem
- R1 is unable to form an OSPF neighbor relationship with R2.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 and R2 form an OSPF neighbor relationship.
- Once connectivity is fully restored, R1’s Loopback 0 Interface (1.1.1.1) should be able to ping R2’s Loopback 0 Interface (2.2.2.2).

## Trouble Ticket #2

### Problem
- After OSPF connectivity was restored between R1 and R2 you have noticed the network 1.0.0.0/32 in R2’s routing table.

### Desired outcome
- Configure the network so that R1 sends R2 its correct subnet mask information for Interface Loopback 0.
- You may use any method possible to complete this task.
